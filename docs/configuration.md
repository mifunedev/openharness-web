# Configuration

Open Harness has two authored configuration surfaces at the repository root,
split by kind:

| File | Tracked | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `oh.json` | yes | every non-secret setting |
| `.env` | no — gitignored, mode `0600` | secrets only |

A secret must never reach `oh.json`, because `oh.json` is tracked. A non-secret
must never reach `.env`. The split is enforced in code:
`.oh/cli/src/lib/secrets.ts` owns the secret allow-list,
`.oh/cli/src/lib/oh-config.ts` owns the `oh.json` schema and validator, and
`.oh/cli/src/lib/config-render.ts` refuses to render an allow-listed secret into
the compose environment.

`oh init` writes both files. `oh config show` prints the resolved `oh.json` and
`oh config set <field> <value>` edits one dotted field in it; `oh secret set
<KEY>` prompts for a credential with the input hidden and writes it to `.env`,
and `oh secret list` shows which keys hold a value with the values redacted.
`oh config set` refuses a secret key and `oh secret set` refuses a non-secret
key, each pointing at the other command. Apply a change with
`oh stop && oh sandbox`.

## How `oh.json` reaches Docker Compose

`.oh/cli/src/lib/config-render.ts` renders `oh.json` into `KEY=value` lines and
`.oh/scripts/docker-compose.sh` passes them to Compose with `--env-file`. Every
key also has a default baked into `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`, so an
omitted field is not "unset" — it takes that default. A variable already
exported in the shell that runs `oh` beats the value in `oh.json`.

## Field reference

Types are JSON types. "Compose variable" names the variable the field renders
to; `—` means the field is consumed by the `oh` CLI itself and never rendered.

### Identity

| Field | Type | Default | Compose variable | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `version` | number | `1` | — | Schema version. Must be `1`. |
| `name` | string | directory name | `SANDBOX_NAME` | Container and Compose project name. |
| `timezone` | string | `America/Los_Angeles` | `TZ` | Timezone for cron schedules and log timestamps. |
| `projectRoot` | string | `/home/sandbox/harness` | `OH_PROJECT_ROOT` | Container path the repository is mounted at. Leave at the default unless relocating the project root. |

### Git identity inside the sandbox

| Field | Type | Default | Compose variable | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `git.userName` | string | unset | `GIT_USER_NAME` | `user.name` for commits made inside the sandbox. Spaces are fine. |
| `git.userEmail` | string | unset | `GIT_USER_EMAIL` | `user.email` for commits made inside the sandbox. |

### Optional installs

All off by default. `oh harness install <name>` flips the matching field and
installs into the running sandbox with no rebuild. The four harness fields map
to `oh harness` names: `opencode`, `grok-build`, `deepagents`, `hermes`.
`agentBrowser` is not a harness — `oh tool install agent-browser` manages it.

| Field | Type | Default | Compose variable | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `install.opencode` | boolean | `false` | `INSTALL_OPENCODE` | Build the OpenCode CLI into the image. |
| `install.grokBuild` | boolean | `false` | `INSTALL_GROK_BUILD` | Build the Grok Build CLI into the image. |
| `install.deepagents` | boolean | `false` | `INSTALL_DEEPAGENTS` | Build the DeepAgents CLI into the image. |
| `install.hermes` | boolean | `false` | `INSTALL_HERMES` | Build the Hermes CLI into the image and enable its runtime wiring. |
| `install.agentBrowser` | boolean | `false` | `INSTALL_AGENT_BROWSER` | Install agent-browser and Chromium (about 1 GB). |

### Access

| Field | Type | Default | Compose variable | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `access.dockerSocket` | boolean | `false` | `DOCKER_SOCKET` | Applies the `docker-compose.docker-sock.yml` overlay. Mounting `/var/run/docker.sock` is effectively HOST ROOT: an agent can start a privileged container that mounts the host filesystem. See [security considerations](https://github.com/mifunedev/openharness/blob/main/docs/security-considerations.md). |
| `access.ssh` | boolean | `false` | `SANDBOX_SSH` | Applies the `docker-compose.ssh.yml` overlay, which runs sshd for direct container SSH. See [sshd](https://github.com/mifunedev/openharness/blob/main/docs/integrations/sshd.md). |
| `access.sshPort` | number (1–65535) | `2222` | `SANDBOX_SSH_PORT` | Host loopback port published for SSH. |
| `access.sshAuthorizedKeys` | string | unset | `SANDBOX_SSH_AUTHORIZED_KEYS` | One or more public keys, newline or literal `\n` separated. This is public key material, not a secret. Without a key and without password auth nobody can log in, and sshd warns loudly. |
| `access.sshPasswordAuth` | boolean | `false` | `SANDBOX_SSH_PASSWORD_AUTH` | Enables SSH password auth, which uses the `SANDBOX_PASSWORD` secret. Never enable it on a public-facing bind while `SANDBOX_PASSWORD` is the default. |

### Hermes dashboard

| Field | Type | Default | Compose variable | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hermesDashboard.enabled` | boolean | `false` | `HERMES_DASHBOARD` | Applies the `docker-compose.hermes-dashboard.yml` overlay and auto-starts the web dashboard. |
| `hermesDashboard.port` | number (1–65535) | `9119` | `HERMES_DASHBOARD_PORT` | Host loopback port for the dashboard. |

### Cron runtime

| Field | Type | Default | Compose variable | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cron.agentBin` | string | `claude` | `CRON_AGENT_BIN` | Binary that fires scheduled tasks. |

### Build behaviour

| Field | Type | Default | Compose variable | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `build.skipPnpmInstall` | boolean | `false` | `SKIP_PNPM_INSTALL` | Renders as `1`/`0`. `1` skips the entrypoint's `pnpm install`. |

### Prebuilt image

Run a published image instead of building from `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`.
Recipe: [prebuilt-image deployment](/docs/docker-deployment).

| Field | Type | Default | Compose variable | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `image.ref` | string | unset | `OH_SANDBOX_IMAGE` | Published image reference, for example `ghcr.io/mifunedev/openharness:latest`. |
| `image.mode` | `"build"` \| `"image"` | `build` | — | Whether the lifecycle builds locally or runs `image.ref`. Pairs with `oh sandbox --image`. |
| `image.pullPolicy` | `"missing"` \| `"always"` \| `"never"` | `missing` | `OH_PULL_POLICY` | Compose pull policy for `image.ref`. |

### Cloud

| Field | Type | Default | Compose variable | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cloud.apiUrl` | string | unset | — | OpenHarness Cloud API base URL used by `oh cloud`. The provisioner key is a secret (`OH_CLOUD_PROVISION_KEY`) and lives in `.env`, never here. |

### Langfuse

Tracing settings the Pi harness reads from its own process environment. They are
not secrets — the Langfuse key pair is, and lives in `.env`. Compose passes both
into the container's environment, so a value set here reaches Pi on the next
sandbox start. An export in the sandbox shell still wins for that shell.

| Field | Type | Default | Compose variable | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `langfuse.baseUrl` | string | unset | `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` | Langfuse host Pi sends traces to, for example `http://langfuse-web:3000`. Takes precedence over `LANGFUSE_HOST`. |
| `langfuse.privacyPreset` | `"metadata-only"` \| `"prompts-only"` \| `"conversations"` \| `"full-debug"` | unset (compose default `metadata-only`) | `LANGFUSE_PRIVACY_PRESET` | How much of each trace Pi captures. Prefer `metadata-only` unless a broader capture policy is approved. |

### Compose overlays

| Field | Type | Default | Compose variable | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `composeOverrides` | string[] | `[]` | — | Extra `-f` overlay paths, applied after the built-in overlays selected by `access` and `hermesDashboard` (last `-f` wins). |

## Secrets

The allow-list in `.oh/cli/src/lib/secrets.ts` is the complete set of keys the
root `.env` may hold. Each is documented, commented out, in the tracked
`.env.example`:

`GH_TOKEN`, `SANDBOX_PASSWORD`, `XAI_API_KEY`, `PI_SLACK_APP_TOKEN`,
`PI_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`,
`OH_CLOUD_PROVISION_KEY`.

Any other key is rejected by `oh secret set`.

## Settings that are neither

A few variables are read directly from the environment of one process and are
not harness configuration at all, so they appear in neither surface:

- `OH_CLOUD_API_URL` and `OH_CLOUD_PROVISION_KEY` — non-persistent `oh cloud`
  overrides for the persisted `cloud.apiUrl` field and the
  `OH_CLOUD_PROVISION_KEY` secret. `OH_PROVISION_KEY` and `PROVISION_KEY` are
  accepted as legacy spellings. See `.oh/cli/README.md`.

## Retired keys

The directory layout is fixed convention and is no longer configurable.
`WORKTREES_DIR`, `PROJECTS_DIR`, and `CRONS_DIR` were removed;
`config-render.ts` refuses to render them. See
[`.oh/` directory layout](https://github.com/mifunedev/openharness/blob/main/docs/oh-directory-layout.md).
